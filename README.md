Image Encryption Tool
This is a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. The tool performs basic operations like pixel value swapping and mathematical transformations on the pixel data to achieve encryption. Users can encrypt an image to obfuscate its contents and decrypt it to restore the original image.

**Features:**
Encrypt images by applying pixel manipulation techniques.
Decrypt images to retrieve the original content.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x
Pillow (PIL) library

**Usage:**
Run the script to either encrypt or decrypt an image.
